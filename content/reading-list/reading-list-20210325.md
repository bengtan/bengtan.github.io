A great breakdown (for the semi-technically inclined) of [what an NFT is](https://wasteofserver.com/nft-exactly-as-they-are/) (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) and a possible reason [why NFTs are valuable](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/nft-value) (⭐⭐⭐⭐).

Who would have thought that a [blog about Google Sheets could have 400k views per month](https://creatorcollabhouse.substack.com/p/how-ben-collins-built-a-google-sheets) (⭐⭐)?

A fun primer into [how emoji's work](https://tonsky.me/blog/emoji/) (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) underneath (It's more complicated than you thought). Every programmer needs to read this and know what a grapheme cluster is.

A scary and sobering [interview with a developer who is losing his sight](https://michelenasti.com/2021/01/28/no-sight-developer.html) (⭐⭐⭐). Wouldn't wish it on anyone.

Anyone wanna [uwu-ify text](https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/uwu) (⭐⭐⭐⭐)? (Warning: Extreme humour ahead.) But what does [uwu](https://studybreaks.com/tvfilm/the-origin-of-the-word-uwu/) (⭐⭐⭐) mean?

[What I learned bootstrapping side projects in 2020](https://mccormick.cx/news/entries/what-i-learned-bootstrapping-side-projects-in-2020) (⭐⭐)
