Hi,

This is [Beng Tan](https://bengtan.com/about/) and welcome to **Interesting Things**, a curation of interesting stories and links from tech, indie biz, science, and related fields.

There's less stories (40) than usual this week (50-ish). I was busy with other things.

But this might be the new normal because (a) I'm working on a new project, and (b) I still hear sometimes that there are too many stories. 😆 (Tip: Just read what you like and ignore the rest.)

I hope you continue to find the stories interesting. If you don't, no worries, you can always [unsubscribe]({{ unsubscribe_url }}).

Happy reading!
