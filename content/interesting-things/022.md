Hi,

This is [Beng Tan](https://bengtan.com/about/) and welcome to **Interesting Things**, a curation of interesting stories and links from tech, work, biz, science, life and stuff.

Been crazy busy this week so I didn't get through as much as I normally do. But I have been thinking about cutting down a bit anyway as it makes this newsletter more digestible. Maybe this is a sign of things to come.

Anyway, happy reading!
