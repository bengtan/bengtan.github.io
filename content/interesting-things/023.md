Hi,

This is [Beng Tan](https://bengtan.com/about/) and welcome to **Interesting Things**, a curation of interesting stories and links from tech, work, biz, science, life and stuff.

This week has also been busy but I'm also mixing up how I do things and making some adjustments to the content. Less stories, more quality. Better signal-to-noise ratio. Or so I hope.

Let's give it a couple of weeks or so for things to settle down, and then we'll see.

In any case, I hope you'll continue to like the stories. Happy reading!
