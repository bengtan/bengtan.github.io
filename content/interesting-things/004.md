Hi!

Welcome to the fourth edition of Interesting Things, a curation of interesting stories and links from tech, indie business, science, and adjacents.

(Housekeeping: I recently moved this newsletter from Substack. This is the first edition to be sent out via Buttondown.)

The following are things I came across during my Internet wanderings. I find them interesting, and I hope you do too.

Happy reading!
