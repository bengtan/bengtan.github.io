Hi,

This is [Beng Tan](https://bengtan.com/about/) and welcome to **Interesting Things**, a curation of interesting stories and links from tech, indie biz, science, and related fields.

I got interesting feedback this week. Someone said they get overwhelmed if a newsletter has tons and tons of info in it. They were referring to this one. üò®

But I'll take this as a compliment. üòÅ

And I will say: **Don't read everything**. Just read what you find interesting and skip the rest. It's a newsletter. It's not gonna vanish into your social media feed. You can always come back later. Or not at all.

Oh, and don't read it all in a day. Spread it out over a week. Relax.

I hope you find the following stories interesting. If you don't, you can [unsubscribe]({{ unsubscribe_url }}) and I won't pollute your inbox again.

Happy reading!
