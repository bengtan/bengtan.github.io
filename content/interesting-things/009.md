Hi,

This is [Beng Tan](https://bengtan.com/about/) and welcome to **Interesting Things**, a curation of interesting stories and links from tech, indie biz, science, and related fields.

There are a lot of new subscribers this week. A very warm welcome to you all. I hope you like what you've found here.

I'm experimenting a bit with the content and presentation. There might be some fluctuations over the next few weeks before things settle down.

I hope you continue to find the stories interesting. If you don't, no worries, you can always [unsubscribe]({{ unsubscribe_url }}).

Happy reading!
