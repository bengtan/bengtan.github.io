TL;DR: This is the last issue of Interesting Things. Read on.

Hi,

When I started Interesting Things, I was in the middle of a year-long sabbatical from work. Covid-induced, sure, but it was an opportunity to take a break, do some random things, scratch an itch or two, and try new stuff. One of which was writing my own accounting software (!). Another was a newsletter.

A few months after starting Interesting Things, I went back into the job market and started working again on a new project. I managed to keep going at the newsletter. For an entire year, in total.

But over time, things change. Priorities change. Perspectives change.

This project I'm currently on is a full-time endeavour and it's taking up a big majority of my attention. My discretionary time is now at a premium. And scarce. (Some personal things also popped up too.)

Partly, I don't have the energy and motivation to keep at the newsletter anymore. Partly, I want some of my own time back. Or perhaps they are the same thing. In any case, the outcome is the same.

All things come to an end. And for now, this is the end of Interesting Things. It's been a great and enjoyable journey. I learnt many interesting things and read lots of great content and articles. I will look back on this time fondly, and apply what I have learnt for the times ahead.

A great and wonderful thanks to all of my readers. Thanks for putting up with my emails week after week. I hope they weren't too intrusive, and I hope you found some interesting content in amongst the stuff I sent you.

Is this good bye? For now, yes. For ever, I don't know.

(Who knows what the future might bring? Maybe in a few years time I might take another sabbatical and, in a fit of restlessness, start Interesting Things up again. Stranger things have happened. If you want to be notified of such an occurrence, please subscribe to Interesting Things or my blog. Disclaimer: You might not receive anything for years, or at all.)

May we meet again. Thank you, so long, and thanks for all the fish.

Beng Tan
