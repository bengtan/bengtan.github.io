**Interesting Things** is a weekly email newsletter. Free.

It curates interesting stories and links from technology; adjacent fields such as indie business, science, and productivity; and whatever else I find interesting. I try to stay away from politics, product/press releases and bigcorp stuff.

If you'd like to read stuff that isn't covered by the mainstream tech press, please give it a try. It is sent out every Friday and usually has about 40-50 links.

**Warning:** Don't read everything. It'll be overwhelming. Just read what you find interesting and skip the rest. 😁
