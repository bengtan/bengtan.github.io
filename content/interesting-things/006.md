Hi,

This is [Beng Tan](https://bengtan.com/about/) and welcome to **Interesting Things**, a curation of interesting stories and links from tech, indie biz, science, and related fields.

Wow, I've only been doing this for about a month and it's the sixth edition already. Time flies.

This edition has a COVID-related article. I try to stay away from pandemic related news since it's usually entangled with politics, but this time, I included an article for the science.

I hope you find the following stories interesting. If you don't, you can [unsubscribe]({{ unsubscribe_url }}) and I won't pollute your inbox again.

Happy reading!
