# About

Hi,

I have wide ranging experience with software and technology.

I'm a self-motivated person and always learning new things.

I'm a creative thinker who is able to take a multi-disciplinary approach to solving problems.

I don't just do 'software', but also the business, legal, social and startup issues around software. (I'm well-read on startup literature.)

I'm a problem solver. Give me a problem and throw me in the deep end. You don't have to keep checking on me. I'll find a way out. I'll either solve the problem or provide you with the necessary information to make an informed decision.

I'm good at debugging hard problems. Especially the ones that no one else wants to do.

I keep myself busy. You can see from my work history that, if not employed, I always have a side project happening. But don't let that deter you. I'm always willing to shuffle my priorities for the right opportunity.

Thank you for reading.

(No recruiters please.)
