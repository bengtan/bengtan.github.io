As I alluded in my [status update](/blog/status-update-20210414/), I've been setting up an [email newsletter](/newsletter). Finally it's ready and I posted the [first issue](/interesting-things/001) last Friday.

I've named it **Interesting Things** because it's a curation of interesting stories and links from tech, indie business, science, and adjacents. Basically, stuff that I find interesting.

Here's what I wrote about it:

> Interesting Things is mainly developer-oriented since it's a curation of stuff that I read. However, there's enough things that, I hope, there's something for everyone.
> 
> I try to stay away from stories which are somewhat political.
> 
> I tend to omit things which have already been rehashed by tech news websites. Instead, I prefer stories from the trenches/coalface/grassroots of people actually doing stuff.
> 
> Since I dabble in side projects, there's also stories about the business of technology. But again, not mainstream news nor big tech. More 'indie' (for lack of a better word).
> 
> I include some science stories since I think technical-oriented people are casually interested in science. I know I am.
> 
> I hope you'll like Interesting Things. You probably don't have the same set of interests that I do, but hopefully, you'll find some good stuff here.

and:

> Also, don't forget to subscribe. It's free.
> 
> If you subscribe, you won't miss out on any of Interesting Things. Even if you only read Interesting Things on the web, the subscription will notify you when a new issue comes out (and then you can delete the email).
> 
> And I confess ... If you subscribe, then I know how many people are reading. This is important to me.
> 
> So if you read Interesting Things, please subscribe.
> 
> Thank you!
