Sorry, I stopped blogging for a while.

Astute readers will have noticed that I haven't posted any original blog posts for a few weeks. I've been irregularly posting [Reading Lists](/reading-list) instead.

Reason?

I'm tinkering with setting up an email newsletter of curated links. I do a lot of reading every week and I think some of the more interesting stories I come across would also be interesting to other people.

I've been trying out different things and experimenting with different formats. I'm not quite happy with it yet.

However, once that's done (in a couple more weeks?), I'll be back to blogging or some other side project. It won't be long!
