    <p>My preferred email newsletter provider is Buttondown but when I set up my newsletter <strong><a href="/interesting-things">Interesting Things</a></strong>, I chose Substack. However, after two weeks, the warm glow of Substack had subsided and I moved it over to Buttondown. Here&rsquo;s the story.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-chose-substack">Why I chose Substack</h2>
<p><strong>Free</strong></p>
<p>I admit it. My main reason for choosing Substack was because it&rsquo;s free/freemium.</p>
<p>Sending bulk email costs money. Every email newsletter provider that I know of (other than Substack) provides a limited free tier and then charges money beyond that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a believer that side projects should be cashflow positive since they can sometimes be in suspended animation for long periods of time. I didn&rsquo;t know how <strong>Interesting Things</strong> was going to pan out so any way to avoid costs was attractive.</p>
<p>(There&rsquo;s also some historical background here. I previously had another unrelated email list which was gaining 200+ subscribers a month but I had lost interest in the topic and wasn&rsquo;t going to post to it anymore. However, the list kept growing and I had no way to monetise it or recover costs. So I had to kill it. I guess there&rsquo;s a bit of trauma residue here.)</p>
<p>Since Substack was free/freemium, it was liberating not having to care about how large the subscriber list got. Even if it was hundreds of thousands of subscribers, even if most of the subscribers was spam/fake, as long as I didn&rsquo;t turn it into a paid subscription, I didn&rsquo;t have to pay anything. As a tool, Substack would always be cashflow positive.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery</strong></p>
<p>The second reason was discovery.</p>
<p>Substack has a list of technology publications. I figured once I get listed on there, it would help me get new readers. (Little did I know this was a delusion of grandeur.)</p>
<p><strong>Mind share</strong></p>
<p>Finally, it seemed like Substack is all the rage and everyone and their dog was using it. Should be fine, right? I jumped into it without thinking much.</p>
<!--
Why I chose Substack
* Free
  * Had a newsletter that was gaining 200+ subscribers a month. Not monetisable. Help! I don't want to pay.
* Discovery
* Mind share. 'Everyone was using it'. Shouldn't be too bad, right?
-->
<h2 id="what-happened-after-i-launched">What happened after I launched</h2>
<p>I posted the first two issues of <strong>Interesting Things</strong> to various places on the Internet. For each posting, I got a burst of 20-80 views and a few subscribers, and then, nothing. After two weeks, I had 18 subscribers.</p>
<p>Hmmm &hellip; okay. Now I have some real numbers and learned some things.</p>
<p>All the readers are my readers. I found them on the Internet. Substack didn&rsquo;t give me any page views. Okay, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting them to since I was so tiny. But at the current rate, I&rsquo;m guessing it will be years before I would be prominent enough for Substack discovery to kick in. Sorry, but that&rsquo;s too long to wait for.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t in danger of reaching 1000 subscribers anytime soon. (1000 subscribers is when Buttondown&rsquo;s paid tier begins. I compare against Buttondown since if it wasn&rsquo;t for Substack, I&rsquo;d be using Buttondown.)</p>
<p>I read about a newsletter <a href="https://theslice.co/">TheSlice</a> which has a tangentially similar audience. At about 400-600 (?) subscribers, it started monetising and became cashflow positive.</p>
<p>This made me think. If I hit 1000 subscribers, and needed to, I could do similar things to what they did in order to remain cashflow positive. I need not be worried about the uncertainty of recovering costs.</p>
<p>And so, the reasons for choosing Substack got refuted one by one.</p>
<p>Freemium? Not an advantage anymore. I&rsquo;m now confident I can (lightly) monetise and remain cashflow positive if I were to reach 1000+ subscribers.</p>
<p>Discovery? Not happening.</p>
<p>Mind-share? My sentiment changed.</p>
<!--
What happened after I launched?
* Only getting a few subscribers for each posting. ie. Low double digits a week.
  * Discovery wasn't going to happen until 10+ years later
  * Not in imminent danger of hitting 1000 subscribers
* Did some math and realised that, if hit 1000 subscribers, would be able to monetise to pay the costs
-->
<h2 id="the-warm-glow-had-worn-off">The warm glow had worn off</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how quickly different things become noticeable when sentiment changes. I was initially quite happy using Substack. However, after two weeks and reality hit, the warm glow of Substack had worn off and the shortcomings became apparent. I guessed I must have initially glossed over these because I wanted Substack to win.</p>
<p>Once I realised the benefits weren&rsquo;t there, the downsides came into focus.</p>
<p><strong>Software is very basic</strong></p>
<p>Compared to other email newsletter providers, Substack&rsquo;s feature set is very basic. There&rsquo;s not a lot of things that can be changed or tweaked. This could be a good thing for someone who&rsquo;s new to being a creator. For me, it feels limiting.</p>
<p><strong>Subdomain website is poor</strong></p>
<p>Each substack account gets a subdomain website but the website is unoptimised and very basic.</p>
<p>There are too many clicks needed to get to what you want.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s both too much whitespace and inefficient use of space. Maybe they were trying for a minimalistic look. But it doesn&rsquo;t look minimal to me. It looks unfinished instead.</p>
<p>The website feels like a wireframe that didn&rsquo;t get coloured in. There&rsquo;s nothing between the lines. No texture. No vibe. Just &hellip; bland.</p>
<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;ll stop before it becomes a rant. Let me just finish with: If I was paying $1000+ per year for it (which I&rsquo;m not, but many people are), it&rsquo;s not pretty enough.</p>
<p><strong>No benefit from the &lsquo;platform&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>There was no benefit for me from being on the Substack &lsquo;platform&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s no cross-promotion. There&rsquo;s no free page views. There&rsquo;s no network effect. (Okay, there is a &lsquo;community&rsquo; tab and a comments feature, but the vast majority of readers aren&rsquo;t there.)</p>
<p>Substack just gives you a very basic email newsletter (which is not very good, features wise) and a very basic website (which is also not very good). Everything else you have to do yourself.</p>
<p>If I already had thousands of subscribers, maybe Substack would promote me and discover new readers. Then it&rsquo;d be worth being on Substack.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<!--
* Software is very basic
* Hard to cross-promote since it's own sub-site. Sub-site is very rudimentary/basic.
* No promotional assistance from substack. It's all from my 'own' audience.

It's weird but I don't notice this stuff whilst in the warm glow of substack. But now the warm glow is gone.
-->
<h2 id="going-back-to-buttondown">Going back to Buttondown</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason for me to be on Substack anymore.</p>
<p>My main problem was discovery. How was I going to get users to find out about <strong>Interesting Things</strong>? I decided that I should integrate it more closely with my website and cross-promote with my blog.</p>
<p>This is where Substack gets in the way. I feel that Substack designs it&rsquo;s software to drive traffic to the subdomain website (and transitively, to Substack itself). This is fine if you fit within Substack&rsquo;s main use case. But if you want to do something just a little different, Substack&rsquo;s lack of customisability creates unnecessary friction.</p>
<p>In order to better integrate with my website, I needed to move away from Substack.</p>
<p>Hence, after two weeks (and confident that <strong>Interesting Things</strong> can remain cashflow positive) I went scurrying back to Buttondown.</p>
<p>I like Buttondown because it&rsquo;s a bit nerdy, it&rsquo;s natively markdown, it&rsquo;s cheaper than most, and I can disable user tracking. I can also integrate it closely with my website and cross-promote more effectively.</p>
<p>Those are good reasons for me.</p>
<p>(Since I&rsquo;m contrasting with Substack, I should also mention for completeness that Buttondown also has a paid subscriptions feature. At 0% commission.)</p>
<!--
Why go to buttondown?
* Like buttondown since it's 'nerdy' ie. natively markdown
* Doesn't track users (much?)
* Positive cashflow
* Had to solve problem of 10+ new 'phantom' subscribers/day
* Could integrate into existing blog/website and cross-promote (not buttondown-specific)

<p>(The main topic has finished but feel free to read on for more about Substack.)</p>
<h2 id="appendix-more-reflections-on-substack">Appendix: More reflections on Substack</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s odd. I&rsquo;ve done a complete 180-degree turn on Substack.</p>
<p>I was pretty hot on Substack at one point. I was <a href="/blog/twitter-super-follows-transformative/#substack">gushing about it&rsquo;s business model of having &lsquo;aligned incentives&rsquo;</a> and I wrote about <a href="/blog/how-to-use-markdown-not-supported-substack/">how to use markdown</a> with it.</p>
<p>But now, after a reality check, I&rsquo;ve gone a bit cold about it.</p>
<p>I wonder what Substack&rsquo;s management are thinking. From my perspective, they&rsquo;ve got problems. Their feature set is poor and their subdomain websites are anemic. For a company that&rsquo;s getting a lot of positive media coverage, their software doesn&rsquo;t match up. Of course, I&rsquo;m just one random person on the Net, but I imagine there are lots of others out there like me.</p>
<p>Other service providers offer better features for much less. If Substack wants to charge $1000+ or more per year, it&rsquo;s offering needs to be at least comparable with the best. But it&rsquo;s not. Worse, it&rsquo;s noticeably weaker than most (all?) of its competitors.</p>
<p>I feel Substack&rsquo;s customer must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not very tech savvy</li>
<li>Too busy to notice the price gouging</li>
<li>Taken in by the positive marketing and media coverage (like as I was)</li>
</ul>
<p>Substack&rsquo;s marketing and media coverage is great. But that&rsquo;s not a very robust moat. Eventually, users are going to see through the illusion and be tempted by competitors which have better features, or cheaper pricing, or both.</p>
<p>Perhaps Substack&rsquo;s management knows this. Maybe this is why they&rsquo;ve introduced community features and a web-based rss reader. So readers stay logged in and Substack can pivot into a social network and build a moat. I guess we&rsquo;ll see in a few years time.</p>
<!--
Reflections on substack
* Feature set is terrible. Definitely not expected if paying $1000 a year.
* Substack has a narrow view of a publisher/author: Not very tech savvy. Doesn't have an existing online presence. Too busy to notice the price gouging.
* Everything is hardcoded to support this narrow segment.
* If you're not in this narrow segment, then it just gets in the way.
* Marketing trumps product ??
