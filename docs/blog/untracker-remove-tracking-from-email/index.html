    <h2 id="previously">Previously</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago, I wrote Email Cleaner and started using it to clean tracking links and pixels from my email newsletters. It works well. I can hover over links (or long press for touch devices) and see the URL. I can click on them <strong>without being tracked</strong>. I can protect myself from phishing.</p>
<p>When I <a href="/blog/email-cleaner-clean-tracking-links-and-pixels/">announced Email Cleaner</a> to the world, I got <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26293424">some feedback</a> from the great people at Hacker News. (I also posted to a couple of other places but didn&rsquo;t get any comments.)</p>
<p>Two things stood out in the feedback.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; you get my Email address and newsletters I like. &hellip; Now it is a question of trusting a random guy on the internet to be better and not sell my data to the highest bidder. Maybe open source could address this to some extend.</p>
<p>&ndash; <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26313017">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26313017</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were privacy concerns. Some didn&rsquo;t like the idea of sending their email newsletters to a third party. Fair enough, I understand.</p>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this [is] something that should be directly integrated into email clients, not something I would get a third party app for</p>
<p>&ndash; <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26300617">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26300617</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was suggested that a service such as Email Cleaner should be integrated into the email client. I agree and disagree. It naturally belongs in the email system though not necessarily at the client side.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m probably biased. Working with email clients is like fighting a multi-headed hydra. I don&rsquo;t want to go there. 😊)</p>
<p>I came up with a new approach to address these concerns. I could rewrite Email Cleaner to be self-hosted, open source, and plug into mail servers.</p>
<p>It would be like &lsquo;Email Cleaner v2&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But I still want to monetise it somehow. (I know this can be controversial. Read more about it below.)</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to talk about this and see what you, the readers and potential users, think. It will help me guage whether this is viable.</p>
<p>Even if you disagree with me, the discussion below about monetising open source is still interesting.</p>
<h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>
<p>What is Email Cleaner v2?</p>
<p>Firstly, I&rsquo;m going to change the name to Untracker. Emphasising the anti-tracking aspect seems to connect with users better. It&rsquo;s still the same functionality as before but with different packaging and branding.</p>
<p>(From here on, Email Cleaner refers to the original SaaS service. Untracker refers to this new &lsquo;v2&rsquo; proposal.)</p>
<p>Untracker will be an <strong>open source</strong> utility that can be plugged into <strong>self-hosted</strong> email servers.</p>
<p>Untracker sits in front of an email mailbox (like a Mail Delivery Agent). When it receives an email, it processes the email by cleaning tracking links and pixels. (For an explanation of what cleaning involves, <a href="/blog/email-cleaner-clean-tracking-links-and-pixels/">please see the previous article</a>.)</p>
<p>Then, depending on configuration, it can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send the cleaned email back to the sender, or</li>
<li>Send the cleaned email to a preconfigured email address, or</li>
<li>Deliver the cleaned email to the mailbox.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first mode is how Email Cleaner currently works. Send an email newsletter to it and it will reply with the cleaned version. This mode uses a dedicated email address to reach the service. (For example, Email Cleaner uses <code>email-cleaner@bengtan.com</code>.)</p>
<p>The second mode is a minor variation of the first. It sends to a preconfigured email address instead. This mode uses an intermediate email address (ie. <code>subscriptions@domain</code>) which can act as a man-in-the-middle email forwarder.</p>
<p>The third mode delivers the cleaned email to the user&rsquo;s inbox. Each email newsletter appears in the inbox twice: The original version and the cleaned version. This mode does not require an additional email address. It is the most exciting because it integrates closely with the email system.</p>
<p>Whatever the mode of operation, the emails stay on the server. They are not sent to a third party (ie. me).</p>
<p>Untracker requires that you self-host your own email server. If you&rsquo;re not self-hosting, maybe you can find a friend who is. Your friend can configure Untracker in mode 1 or 2 and you can send your newsletters to it.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t find anyone to run Untracker for you, you can use the original Email Cleaner service (but you&rsquo;d be sending your email newsletters to a third party ie. me).</p>
<h2 id="monetisation">Monetisation</h2>
<p>Self-hosted Untracker will be open source.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve already mentioned above that I want to monetise it somehow. This is important to me. I&rsquo;m trying to <a href="https://onlysponsors.dev/">build a salary</a> for myself so I can work full-time on open source or other projects.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-github-sponsors">The problem with Github Sponsors</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors">Github Sponsors</a> looks like the way to go.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a problem with Github Sponsors. It&rsquo;s the same problem whenever payments are optional. The problem is human nature.</p>
<p>In theory, sponsorship (or synonymously, &lsquo;donationware&rsquo;) sounds great. In practice, the &lsquo;conversion&rsquo; rate is too low. I don&rsquo;t have any hard metrics but I vaguely remember reading articles years ago. They cite the rate of donations to be some crazy low number like 0.001% or something. It&rsquo;s just too low to be practical.</p>
<p>FWIW, I&rsquo;ve also tried donationware in the past, and my experience corroborates with this. People just don&rsquo;t donate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame people. If you&rsquo;re not pushed to pay money for something, you usually don&rsquo;t think about it. It&rsquo;s just the way it is. <strong>Donationware doesn&rsquo;t work unless it&rsquo;s pushed in-your-face</strong>. Massively in-your-face.</p>
<p>I see similar characteristics with Github Sponsors. When I look at developers who offer sponsorship, I often see unsustainably low sponsorship rates.</p>
<p>However, there is an outlier: The <a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it">high profile case</a> of Caleb Porzio, a developer who has <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/calebporzio">1370+ sponsors and $20k+/month</a> (estimated) in sponsorships (and is still growing).</p>
<p><img src="calebporzio-sponsors.jpg" alt="screenshot: calebporzio&rsquo;s sponsors"></p>
<p>Compare this against a core developer of one of the most widely used javascript frameworks. This second developer has the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; low rate of sponsors. He has <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/posva">73 sponsors and $2k/month</a> in sponsorships.</p>
<p><img src="posva-sponsors.png" alt="screenshot: posva&rsquo;s sponsors"></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a massive difference between Caleb and the second developer.</p>
<p>What accounts for the difference? Caleb has less github followers (2.6k vs 2.7k), more twitter followers (23.3k vs 10.8k) and a higher minimum sponsorship tier ($14 vs $1). These aren&rsquo;t the reason. For example, they don&rsquo;t explain the disparity in number of sponsors (1370 vs 73).</p>
<h3 id="payment-decision-point">Payment Decision Point</h3>
<p>I think the reason is hiding in plain sight: Caleb charges for value added content. He says so himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sponsored Screencasts &hellip; This is where the VAST majority of my sponsorships came from.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A few weeks later I added a new “private” group of screencasts for GitHub sponsors only. &hellip; THIS is the secret sauce 🌶️.</p>
<p>&ndash; <a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it">https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His sponsorships aren&rsquo;t really sponsorships in the usual sense of the word. Instead, they are payments for premium content.</p>
<p>This comes back to what I said above. Donationware doesn&rsquo;t work unless it&rsquo;s in-your-face. There is nothing more in-your-face than &lsquo;you have to pay for this&rsquo;.</p>
<p>People are paying Caleb because they want to sponsor him but also because they want content. I suspect the latter is much greater than the former.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another statistic. During the few days between conceptualising and then writing this article, the number of his sponsors has gone from 1331 to 1370. That&rsquo;s 39 new sponsors in a few days. Wow.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t expect such a high rate of new sponsors if it was purely to sponsor him per se. There&rsquo;s something else going on.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>Anyway. This makes me think.</p>
<p>If I want to make &lsquo;sponsored open source&rsquo; work, there has to be a payment for <em>something</em>. And the <em>something</em> has to be (somewhat) valuable.</p>
<p>There has to be a &lsquo;Payment Decision Point&rsquo; where potential sponsors are forced to confront the question &lsquo;Oh, is this where I make a payment now?&rsquo;. Otherwise people won&rsquo;t think about it. They&rsquo;ll move on.</p>
<p>To achieve sustainable sponsorship with Untracker, I have to put something behind a paywall.</p>
<h2 id="untrackers-sponsorship-model">Untracker&rsquo;s sponsorship model</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the proposed sponsorship model with an in-built Payment Decision Point. I hope this will allow Untracker to be both open source and monetised.</p>
<ul>
<li>A public repository will contain the compiled binary and entry level documentation.</li>
<li>The binary will be free for non-commercial use.</li>
<li>Source code and advanced documentation will be in a private repository accessible by sponsors only.</li>
<li>The source code will be open source. I&rsquo;ve currently settled on the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">Affero General Public License Version 3</a> (AGPL) license.</li>
<li>Sponsors are encouraged to build from source. Commercial usage is allowed under the open source license.</li>
<li>Sponsorship starts at $12 per month. Higher tiers are available for super fans and companies. I&rsquo;ll regularly review the sponsorship tiers for suitability.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a freemium model. Most people can use Untracker for free but sponsorship unlocks further benefits.</p>
<p>Sponsors get all the usual benefits of open source. They can inspect and modify the source code. They get access to support.</p>
<p>They can also redistribute the source code. I hope they don&rsquo;t though I can&rsquo;t enforce it. Redistribution would completely break this model.</p>
<p>I hope sponsors see value in continuing sponsorship. It pays for support, new features (see below) and ongoing maintenance. Maintenance will be required because this is a cat-and-mouse game with the mailing list providers. Once they learn about Untracker, I expect them to change their tracking links to try to avoid it.</p>
<p>For me, I get:</p>
<ul>
<li>To continue to work on Untracker, and</li>
<li>One component of my quest to build a salary for myself.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this model strikes a good balance for everyone and nurtures both Untracker and the Untracker community.</p>
<h2 id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h2>
<p>Some other random information. Skip over any uninteresting bits.</p>
<h3 id="rewrite">Rewrite</h3>
<p>Untracker will be a completely new rewrite. The original Email Cleaner code has some hardcoded constants specific to my internal email setup and is unsuitable for publishing.</p>
<p>Untracker will be written in golang and compiles to a single CLI binary.</p>
<h3 id="bypassing-tracking-entirely">Bypassing tracking entirely</h3>
<p>I have one really great feature in mind.</p>
<p>Normally, the destination URL of a tracking link is discovered by crawling it. This triggers a one-off tracking event at the mailing list provider.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve since discovered that some mailing list providers encode the destination URL in the link itself. For these cases, Untracker can decode the URL without crawling, thus <strong>bypassing tracking</strong> entirely.</p>
<h3 id="other-features">Other features</h3>
<p>Some other features I&rsquo;d like to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert emails to plain text (or rather, just omit the HTML part) — The ultimate in privacy.</li>
<li>&lsquo;Deep inspection&rsquo; mode which crawls all links and images and report any which are trackers. Useful for detecting new, unknown trackers.</li>
<li>Crawling via a HTTP proxy (or tor!)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="one-time-sponsorship-as-a-payment">One-time sponsorship as a payment</h3>
<p>A user could sponsor, download the source code, and then unsponsor. They&rsquo;d be effectively &lsquo;buying&rsquo; the source code for $12. I&rsquo;m fine with this. I don&rsquo;t want to complicate the revenue model just to extract a bit more money.</p>
<p>But I hope that when they join, they like what they see and decide to stay.</p>
<h3 id="open-source-not-open-contribution">Open source, not open contribution</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve currently decided not to accept source code patches. This is for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>I can restrain creeping featurism and keep the code tight, thus reducing long term maintenance burden and potential for burn-out.</p>
<p>It avoids any ambiguity over copyright of Untracker. I would like to retain copyright over it.</p>
<p>Some FLOSS contributors get upset when open source software (which has some community-contributed patches) is monetised or relicensed under a different software license. I don&rsquo;t have an opinion on this argument but I&rsquo;d like to avoid it entirely.</p>
<p>I hope I don&rsquo;t sound unfriendly about this. I&rsquo;d be happy for the community to get involved and post bug reports and feature requests. These activities are valuable too. Software development isn&rsquo;t just coding.</p>
<p>If you do submit source code patches, I&rsquo;d happily look at them but I&rsquo;d rewrite them from scratch.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-licensing">Alternative licensing</h3>
<p>If any sponsors find the AGPL unsuitable for their use, please contact me and we can work something out.</p>
<h3 id="untracking-regular-email">Untracking regular email</h3>
<p>In theory, Untracker can untrack all email, not just newsletters. In practice, there might be some weird cases which break. For now, I recommend passing only newsletters through Untracker.</p>
<p>Expanding Untracker to handle all email is a possible long term goal.</p>
<h3 id="original-email-cleaner-service">Original Email Cleaner service</h3>
<p>I will continue to operate the original Email Cleaner service. I still use it myself. Maybe there is demand for a SaaS version of Untracker.</p>
<p>At some point, Email Cleaner will be powered by Untracker code instead of the old code. However, there is no need for existing users to take any action.</p>
<p>Incidentally, here&rsquo;s a big &lsquo;Thank You!&rsquo; to the users of Email Cleaner.</p>
<p>They have provided me with new, previously un-represented, test cases. This has resulted in increased coverage of tracking links. The improvements will feed into Untracker.</p>
<h2 id="hope">Hope</h2>
<p>I hope Untracker succeeds and many people find it useful.</p>
<p>I hope the sponsorship model turns out to be a good compromise between the traditional tensions of open source vs monetisation. If it inspires others to attain more funding for open source software, then all the better.</p>
<p>I also hope my thoughts about Payment Decision Points helps others &lsquo;crack the code&rsquo; and replicate Caleb Porzio&rsquo;s so-far-unreplicated success with sponsorships. Was it insightful? Only time will tell.</p>
<h2 id="feedback-and-validation">Feedback and validation</h2>
<p>Disclaimer: I haven&rsquo;t done any of the above. I haven&rsquo;t started Untracker.</p>
<p>So far, Untracker is just a bunch of ideas and an article — A proposal awaiting feedback and validation.</p>
<p>I hope it generates a lot of interest, as that is a sure sign that I should proceed. But I can&rsquo;t be certain. This is why I&rsquo;d like to ask for your feedback. If you have any feedback, comments or questions, I&rsquo;d love to hear it.</p>
<p>This has been a long article so here&rsquo;s a refresher of sub-topics.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think about the name change to Untracker?</li>
<li>What do you think about Untracker (as a product)?</li>
<li>What do you think about Untracker being open source but requiring self-hosting?</li>
<li>What do you think of the discussion about Github Sponsors and the Payment Decision Point?</li>
<li>What do you think about Untracker&rsquo;s freemium/monetisation/sponsorship model?</li>
</ul>
